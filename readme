## 🚀 Features

### **Core Experience**
*   **Native Look & Feel**: Frameless window design with custom title bar, glassmorphism effects, and smooth animations.
*   **Dark Mode**: Sleek, eye-friendly dark theme optimized for long browsing sessions.
*   **Performance First**: Built-in Memory Saver automatically suspends inactive tabs to free up RAM.
*   **Focus Mode (`F11`)**: Distraction-free browsing that hides all UI elements.

### **Privacy & Security**
*   **Strict Incognito Mode**: 
    *   **No History**: Browsing history is completely disabled.
    *   **Isolated Sessions**: Each Incognito tab runs in a unique, ephemeral partition for maximum privacy (no shared cookies between tabs).
    *   **Visual Indicators**: Clearly marked "InPrivate" badges and dark address bar.
*   **Ad & Tracker Blocker**: Integrated blocking for ads and tracking scripts.
*   **Smart Privacy**: Proxy support available in settings.

### **Productivity Tools**
*   **AI Sidebar**: Built-in AI assistant integration (WebLLM/Ollama) for page summarization and chat.
*   **Download Manager**: Full control over downloads (Pause, Resume, Cancel, Open Folder).
*   **Benchmarks**: Built-in "Smart Limit" to aggressively manage resources when RAM usage is high.
*   **Customization**: Set custom search engines, homepage, and themes.
